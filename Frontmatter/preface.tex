    Crispin Agar was born and raised in the Allen Valleys in south west Northumberland, lovingly referred to as `Narnia' for its quirks.
    After attending the small local schools, he began studying Physics with Astrophysics at the University of Manchester in 2013, graduating with a 2.1 in 2017. 
    He first became interested in pulsars during a radio astronomy experiment at Jodrell Bank in his third year, and completed a summer project on mapping their emission regions in 2016 with Garvin Yim, supervised by Dr Patrick Weltevrede.
    He and Garvin continued working on pulsars for their MPhys project in fourth year, where they worked on constraining the emission geometry using polarisation information, again supervised by Patrick. 
    In 2017 Crispin began his PhD in the Pulsars and Time Domain Astrophysics group at Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, the culmination of which is this thesis.
