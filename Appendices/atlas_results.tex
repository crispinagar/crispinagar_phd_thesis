% Temporary appendix for the B0031 chapter

\chapter{\texorpdfstring{PSR~B0031$-$07}{PSR~B0031--07} carousel atlas} % Main appendix title
\label{app: atlas results}


This appendix contains a series of plots to show the results of the atlas of geometry parameters explored in Chapter~\ref{chapt: B0031} for PSR~B0031$-$07. The full atlas contains 64 entries for each drift mode, but that is reduced here to 32 in order to save space. The results for the higher alias orders $n=5$ and $n=10$ were excluded as they do not differ significantly from the results for $n=1$ and $n=0$ respectively. An image of the full polar emission region is also left out, but the magnified view of the sub-beams is included as it provides more useful insights. The mixing matrices for all 32 results for each drift mode are combined into the single figure in the main chapter (Fig.~\ref{fig: B0031 - atlas matrices}). Table~\ref{tab: appendix atlas parameters} shows a summary of the geometry parameters which are covered by the figures in this appendix.
